## Doc
This folder will contain all .doc files corresponding to federal laws. These will be downloaded after executing the script from scrape.py. The file "docnames.csv" is also stored here, as it is generated during the data download. It is further used in the passage retrieval step.

If you want to avoid downloading all federal laws, you can. Necessary files are uploaded in this repository.
