# Crime and Punishment
## A machine for federal crime sentences
#### By Carlos Grandet & Hector Salvador

## Leyes
This folder contains all the current federal laws. Since we couldn't find a tool that would turn from .doc to .txt documents without losing format or adding additional characters (such as non-utf8 characters or newlines), we manually converted them to txt. They are all utf-8 encoded.

Hopefully, nobody needing Mexican laws in .txt will ever need to manually convert them.
